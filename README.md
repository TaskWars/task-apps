# task-apps
Just some fun and learning building ToDo/Task management apps with Python, PostgreSQL, JavaScript (ES2015), ReactJS, Redux and some more technologies.

## Introduction
We are a tiny team of 2 web developers/1 designer, who started using ReactJS early 2016 at Mylittlejob. We have worked previously with JS frameworks but the mix of ReactJS and ReduxJS really made us feel inclined to build a single page app based experience for the Mylittlejob platform. We have learnt a lot in just 6 months, and in this project we intend to help others learn and build something practical. The aim is to build a task management application, starting off with a simple todo app. The feature set is fairly open ended, so with enough support from the community, this might even be a full project management app. We will see!

## Intention
The core intention is to learn, and share that very quickly to others. Learning should be fun and we selected the type of app which you typically keep open as a tab in your browser, needs some offline support, some bi-directional sync and so on. Nothing complicated, but fairly good example of a complete web app. We may leave out some core web functionality in the beginning (like authentication) just to get to the interesting parts quickly.

## Contribution
If you are interested in learning, then just follow through. Star the project if you like it. We will thank you for that. If you find an error, please open an issue or a pull request. If you want to contribute code, please feel free to open a pull request. If you want to send ideas for the actual software being built, just wait till we get a live version of it and you can add it there!
