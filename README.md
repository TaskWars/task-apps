# task-apps
Just some fun and learning building ToDo/Task management apps with Python, PostgreSQL, JavaScript (ES2015), ReactJS

## Introduction
I am Sumit Datta, a web developer, who started using ReactJS early 2016 at Mylittlejob (my employer from 2016). I have worked with a bit of AngularJS, EmberJS, BackboneJS before but the mix of ReactJS and ReduxJS really made me feel comfortable to plan more single page apps and move from being a backend heavy (Python/Django) developer to a full stack, single page app oriented developer. In this project I try to help others learn and build something in a short period of time. The aim is to build a task management application, starting off with a simple todo app. The the goal is fairly open ended, so with enough support from the community, this might even be a full project management app. We will see!

## Intention
The core intention is to learn, and share that very quickly to others. A good task management app is more a by-product. The learning should be fun and I selected the type of app which you typically keep open as a tab in your browser, needs some offline, some bi-directional sync and so on. Nothing complicated, but fairly good example of a complete web app. I may leave out some core web functionality in the beginning (like authentication) just to get to the interesting parts quickly.

## Contribution
If you are interested in learning, then just follow through. Star the project if you like it. I will thank you for that. If you find an error, please open a pull request or and issue. If you want to contribute code, please feel free to open a pull request. If you want to send ideas for the actual software being built, just wait till I get a live version of it and you can add it there!
